            <p>I am Marcin Kimak, soon to be a great web developer. I am living in Chicago, but I origin from Poland – the homeland of truly delicious pierogi!</p>
            <p>Currently, I am CCTV technician with superpowers of an electrician by day and a coder by night, but I am on my way to change my career and become an excellent web developer. Please take a look at my website and my <a href="#Portfolio">works</a>.</p>

          <h2 id="About-me">About</h2>                   <!--  about section  -->
          <p>I came to the USA four years ago. Before that, I was a pretty good electrician in Poland (there is magic happening when you make all those bulbs glow), but from the very beginning, when I moved to Chicago, I knew that one day I would become a web developer. That was my plan and also a dream – and it is hard to find a better place to make your dreams come true than America, right?</p>
          <p>That is why I decided to join Thinkful as a student, which I currently am, and start developing my coding skills. And I already know that it was a great decision and I could not be happier! Creating web pages that impress, improving myself by taking inspiration from well-designed projects, collaborating with creative minds who inspire and push me further and further to cross the boundaries of my skills, that is what makes me thrilled.</p>
          <p>Although I enjoy the front end side of the web development the most, I also find pleasure in solving problems by writing functions. Breaking down a problem into smaller problem-solving tasks, writing code that bravely gets even with any encountered issue - this is gratifying. Don't you agree?</p>
          <p>In my free time, I let my artistic side possess me and create some art. I am focused on photography and graphic designs. You can see some of my works in my portfolio on Behance.</p>
